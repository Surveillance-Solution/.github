# Surveillance Solution Repos
All the repos for the project **Surveillance Solution** should be hosted on this account.

## Repo Naming Convention
Repos' names should always start with 2 uppercase letter denoting the team who will use the repo.  
ex:
- Machine Learning related repo: `ML_repo-name`
- Web development related repo: `WD_repo-name`

## Repo Access
All repos should be created with private visibility. This will limit its visibility to the admin (creator) only.  
To grant access to the rest of the related team, the team should be added as collaborators  
`repo > settings > collaborators and teams > add teams`
